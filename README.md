# MealMe: A smart meal and shopping list planner mobile app
## Application Name: MealMe
## Instructions: 
To use this app, you must navigate into the first MealMe folder and open the MealMe.sln in Visual Studio (Developed in) or Rider IDE
## Description: 
MealMe is an application that plans to implement the use of a food API to allow a user to create a weekly meal planner. It will allow the user to select from meals in the API, and creates a shopping list for the user, with an estimate of the pricing and other information.
## Background and Motivation: 
I believe that with unhealthy food becoming more accessible, in the forms of fast food and ready meals etc, and with how busy life can be for some people, it is getting harder to set out a proper meal plan, which not only helps to prevent food waste (Pickering, 2023), but also promotes healthy eating (Fernandex, Desroaches, Marquis, & Provencher, 2020). Having an easy-to-use mobile application that could make it easier to meal plan would mean more people can cut down their food waste (ultimately their contributions to global warming) and bettering their diet to more healthy eating.
For me personally, before I started at University, I would regularly attend the gym, and have a decent meal plan most weeks, I would also use an app called my fitness pal to track my nutritional data. However, since I have started University, I have found that I do not often have time to focus on my diet, and as such I have put on some weight and find myself eating takeaway more than I should. I think this application would benefit anyone in a similar situation as myself.
